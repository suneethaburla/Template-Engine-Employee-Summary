# Template Engine - Employee Summary

This project describes how to build a Node CLI that takes in information about employees and generates an HTML webpage that displays summaries for each person. 


## Features of the application

The objective is to build a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. This application must also pass all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application will create an HTML file that displays a nicely formatted team roster based on the information provided by the user. The challenge is framed as follows:

```
As a manager
I want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to emails and GitHub profiles
```

The play proceeds as follows:

* Use the [Inquirer npm package](https://github.com/SBoudrias/Inquirer.js/) to prompt the user for their email, id, and specific information based on their role with the company. For instance, an intern may provide their school, whereas an engineer may provide their GitHub username.

* The app will run as a Node CLI to gather information about each employee.

The following workflow is recommended to runt the tests:

1. Run tests
2. Create or update classes to pass a single test case
3. Repeat

## Minimum Requirements

* Functional application.

* GitHub repository with a unique name and a README describing the project.

* User can use the CLI to generate an HTML page that displays information about their team.

* All tests must pass.

### Classes
The project has these classes: `Employee`, `Manager`, `Engineer`,
`Intern`. The tests for these classes are in the `tests` directory.

The first class is an `Employee` parent class with the following properties and
methods:

  * name
  * id
  * title
  * getName()
  * getId()
  * getEmail()
  * getRole() // Returns 'Employee'

The other three classes will extend `Employee`. 

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Manager` will also have:

  * officeNumber

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Manager'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Engineer` will also have:

  * github  // GitHub username

  * getGithub()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Engineer'

In addition to `Employee`'s properties and methods, `Intern` will also have:

  * school 

  * getSchool()

  * getRole() // Overridden to return 'Intern'

### User input

The project must prompt the user to build an engineering team. An engineering
team consists of a manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

### Roster output

The project generates a `team.html` page in the `output` directory, that displays a nicely formatted team roster. Each team member should display the following in no particular order:

  * Name

  * Role

  * ID

  * Role-specific property (School, link to GitHub profile, or office number)
